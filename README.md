This repository is a collection of Python concepts, examples, and mini-projects that I learn and practice along my coding journey.

Iâ€™m sharing my progress publicly to stay consistent, learn deeply, and (hopefully) help others who are also learning Python.


(More concepts will be added as I learn!)

ðŸš€ Goals
Learn Python concepts step-by-step

Practice writing clean and efficient code

Share everything in public for accountability
